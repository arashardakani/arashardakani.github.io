I am currently an EECS postdoc at UC Berkeley, advised by Prof. John Wawrzynek. I am also affiliated with Berkeley Institue of Data Scienece (BIDS). Prior to joing UC Berkeley, I was a senior researcher at Noah's Ark Research Lab of Huawei Technologies in Montreal, Canada. I recieved my PhD in electrical and computer engineering from McGill University and my master in electrical engineering from Sharif University of Technology.

My research interests are diverse and include scientific methods for efficient neural computing, memory management in inference and training of large AI models, stochastic computing, edge computing, hardware accelerators, and applications of machine learning for digital hardware design. 

If you find my research interesting, please feel free to contact me at <arash.ardakani@berkeley.edu> for a possible collaboration.
