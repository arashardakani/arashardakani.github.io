This project focuses on developing ML-driven solutions for Electronic Design Automation (EDA) to enhance verification, synthesis, and place-and-route. By leveraging AI, it aims to accelerate verification through GPU-accelerated SAT sampling, optimize synthesis with learning-based techniques, and improve place-and-route using data-driven heuristics that adapt to circuit constraints. Integrating machine learning into these traditionally heuristic-driven processes enhances efficiency, scalability, and automation, enabling faster and more reliable hardware design.
